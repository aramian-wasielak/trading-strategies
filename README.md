# Evaluation of Trading Strategies Using Python

The following basic trading strategies are implemented and evaluated as part of this analysis:

* Bollinger Bands
* Simple Moving Average Cross Over
* Buy and Hold

**[Market-Data-EDA.ipynb](notebooks/Market-Data-EDA.ipynb)**

We start by [analysing](notebooks/Market-Data-EDA.ipynb) the [dataset downloaded from Kaggle]([1]) that contains stock and ETF OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices. This dataset consists of a large number of individual files with each containing market data for one ticker. We first develop a market data API that abstracts away access to ticker files before proceeding with an EDA. We also showcase usage of [Dask]([2]) given that the market data is spread across a number of files and all of the data cannot fit into memory on my laptop.

**[Basic-Strategies.ipynb](notebooks/Basic-Strategies.ipynb)**

We then [implement a simple backtester](notebooks/Basic-Strategies.ipynb) for running trading strategies. As part of it we develop a number of Python classes: Strategy, Backtest, ConfigSearch, etc. The backtester allows us to search for the best perforing ticker & strategy combinations. We run a backtest for all 3 strategies using 5 year's worth of market data.

### Getting Started

Install prerequisites:
```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml 
```
Jupyter notebooks are located under ```notebooks``` directory:

### Potential Future Improvements

* Implement and evaluate the Mean Reversion Pairs Trading strategy

* Develop a more sophisticated backtester
  - Extend the current backtester to support multiple tickers
